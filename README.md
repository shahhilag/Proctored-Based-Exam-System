Project Documentation
</h3> 
<hr>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>Our main objective via this project is to bring uniformity in the online examination system to conduct fair and secure examinations.</li>
<li>As the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives forever it has parallelly also impacted many student lives which has resulted in various challenges, examination being the major one.</li>
<li>A safe and secure examination system is the utmost priority in the present time so that all the students get equal opportunity and the score obtained by the student is equivalent to his/her knowledge.</li>
<li>Our testing tool will be built with the following features-</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Admin will have complete right to upload the questions so that questions are not leaked.</li>
<li>As soon as student enters his/her login credentials we will constantly match his/her photo with the face on the screen(live face detection) to ensure no malpractice and automatically notify the teacher if student has cheated or not.</li>
<li>The test window will automatically be switched to Fullscreen on starting the test and thus no student will be able to open new tabs.</li>
<li>On navigating outside the testing windows or pressing unwanted keyboard shortcuts for cheating during examination will result in the test being terminated.</li>
<li>Lastly, all the student passwords will be encrypted and the teacher will be able to download the result in his local storage from the Admin section to avoid data manipulation and stealing.</li>
</ol>
